# Support Policy

This project is documentation-driven.

- There is **no interactive support** (no DMs, no consulting, no troubleshooting sessions).
- The best-effort support surface is:
  - clear error messages in the app
  - run bundles with reproducible commands (`data/logs/gui_runs/`)
  - the documentation in `docs/` and `RUNBOOK.md`

If you hit an issue:

1. Re-run from the GUI run bundle command (`command.txt`) to reproduce.
2. Check `stdout.log` / `stderr.log` in the run bundle.
3. Search the docs and `RUNBOOK.md`.

Issues/PRs may be closed if they are:
- missing reproduction steps
- missing logs
- specific to an unusual environment
- asking for bespoke strategy development
